    "- [Review requirements for your portfolio project](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2/portfolio-project/ds6), then choose your dataset, and [submit this form](https://forms.gle/nyWURUg65x1UTRNV9), due yesterday at 3:59pm Pacific.\n",
    "- Submit predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file.) The competition closes today at 3:59pm. Every student should make at least one submission that scores at least 60% accuracy (above the majority class baseline).\n",

    "## Assignment\n",
    "- [ ] Continue to participate in our Kaggle challenge. \n",
    "- [ ] Use scikit-learn for hyperparameter optimization with RandomizedSearchCV.\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your final predictions to our Kaggle competition. Optionally, go to **My Submissions**, and _\"you may select up to 1 submission to be used to count towards your final leaderboard score.\"_ The competition closes today at 3:59pm.\n",
    "- [ ] Add comments and Markdown to your notebook. Clean up your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Doing\n",
    "- Try combining xgboost early stopping, cross-validation, & hyperparameter optimization, with [the \"original\" (non scikit-learn) xgboost API](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#xgboost.cv).\n",
    "- In additon to `RandomizedSearchCV`, scikit-learn has [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). Another library called scikit-optimize has [`BayesSearchCV`](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/sklearn-gridsearchcv-replacement.html). Experiment with these alternatives.\n",
    "- _[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do)_ discusses options for \"Grid-Searching Which Model To Use\" in Chapter 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can even go further in combining GridSearchCV and Pipeline: it is also possible to search over the actual steps being performed in the pipeline (say whether to use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler). This leads to an even bigger search space and should be considered carefully. Trying all possible solutions is usually not a viable machine learning strategy. However, here is an example comparing a RandomForestClassifier and an SVC ...\n",

    "The example is shown in [the accompanying notebook](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python/blob/master/06-algorithm-chains-and-pipelines.ipynb), code cells 35-37. Could you apply this concept to your own pipelines?\n",
